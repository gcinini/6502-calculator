# calculator.asm

## Overview

`calculator.asm` is an assembly language program for the 6502 microprocessor. It implements a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is intended as an educational example for learning 6502 assembly programming.

## Platform

- **Target CPU:** MOS Technology 6502
- **Intended Environment:** Any 6502-based system or emulator (e.g., Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, or VICE emulator)
- **Assembler Compatibility:** Written for standard 6502 assemblers (e.g., [ca65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html), [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/), [XA](https://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/))

## Features

- Accepts two integer operands and an operator (+, -, *, /)
- Displays the result of the calculation
- Handles basic input and output via standard routines (may need adaptation for your platform)

## How to Compile

1. **Choose an assembler** compatible with 6502 assembly (e.g., ca65, vasm, XA).
2. **Assemble the source:**
    - For ca65:
      ```
      ca65 calculator.asm -o calculator.o
      ld65 calculator.o -o calculator.bin -C your_config.cfg
      ```
    - For vasm:
      ```
      vasm6502_oldstyle -Fbin -o calculator.bin calculator.asm
      ```
3. **Load the binary** into your 6502 emulator or hardware.
4. **Run the program** and follow on-screen prompts.

> **Tip:** You may need to adjust input/output routines for your specific hardware or emulator.
